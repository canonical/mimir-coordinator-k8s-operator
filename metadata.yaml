  # On the same mimir_worker interface, the coordinator will accept one relation to a worker per each Mimir component.
  # The relation(s) determine the role(s) the worker will assume.
  # Each Mimir worker can take on multiple roles; however, there can be no role replication among workers related to the
  # same coordinator, which is why we force `limit: 1`.
